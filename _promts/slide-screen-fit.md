**Task**: Analyze and restructure slides in lecture files to ensure they fit on one presentation screen.

## Rules

1. **Screen Fit**: Each slide must fit on one screen when the lecturer presents

   - Avoid content overflow requiring scrolling
   - Keep content focused and concise
   - **Proportion should be close to 16:9** (standard presentation aspect ratio)
2. **Diagram Exception**: Diagrams (Mermaid, flowcharts, architecture) can be larger if needed for clarity
3. **Split Long Slides**: Divide oversized slides into multiple logical slides

   - Maintain coherent flow between split slides
   - Preserve context and continuity
   - Adjust InstructorNotes timing accordingly


## Process

1. Read and analyze the target lecture file
2. Identify slides with excessive content
3. Determine logical split points for oversized slides
4. Create new slide sections with appropriate titles
5. Redistribute content maintaining pedagogical flow
6. Update InstructorNotes with new timing

## Output

- Properly sized slides fitting on one screen
- Clear progression and logical grouping
- All original content preserved
- Improved presentation experience
