**Task**

Rewrite only the `InstructorNotes` for each slide for the file or directory.

**Language & Voice**

* Output in **Polish** (natural academic, B2–C1).
* Spoken, lecturer-ready, clear, engaging.
* Ready to read by the lecturer infront of the students.

**Output Rules**

* Keep the **MDX structure, order, IDs, imports, code, and math** exactly  **unchanged** .
* **Rewrite** the existing `InstructorNotes` section — or  **create it if missing** .
* The `InstructorNotes` should **expand and explain** the content of the slide.
* Use **bold text** to highlight key ideas.
* Write in **short, clear paragraphs** — avoid lists unless the slide itself is a list.
* **Do not mention time** (e.g., avoid phrases like “This will take four to five minutes.”)

**Derive From Slide**

* Use visible slide content/context and existing `InstructorNotes`.
* Add short descriptions for abbreviations.
* Add short descriptions for new concepts.

**Checks	**

* Sounds spoken, not jargon-heavy.
* Only `InstructorNotes` changed.
